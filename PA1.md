## Hurdles

Upfront, the biggest hurdle was understanding the problem. I was thrown off by the new information about DNA, and had to reread to filter out the problem we were solving. 

Once I understood the problem, I was looking for input files. ~~I didn't realize we had to create our own~~. I eventually found them in examples

The next step was planning. I had to start with the part I was unsure about: exceptions. I thought of and listed out all the exceptions I could anticipate. 

I then planned my code in comments and got to work (like a savage).
