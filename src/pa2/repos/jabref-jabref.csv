<h2>XMLUnit for Java 2.8.1</h2>
<p>The only real change when compared to XMLUnit for Java 2.8.0 is the introduction of a new <code>xmlunit-assertj3</code> module that requires AssertJ 3.18.1 or later in order to address a problem with running AssertJ tests in an OSGi environment.</p>
<p>The original <code>xmlunit-assertj</code> module will still be supported.</p>
<p>The full changelog of XMLUnit for Java 2.8.1</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>added a new xmlunit-assertj3 module that requires AssertJ 3.18.1 or later.</p>
<p>This module no longer uses AssertJ internal classes that are not exported to OSGi environments and thus fixes issue <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/xmlunit/xmlunit/issues/203"">#203</a>.</p>
<p>The module (like AssertJ 3.x itself) requires Java 8 at runtime and is similar to xmlunit-assertj but is no drop-in replacement. It uses a different Java package from xmlunit-assertj and <code>CompareAssert</code> will no longer throw a JUnit 4.x <code>ComparisonException</code> but an opentest4j <code>AssertionFailedError</code> instead.</p>
<p>The existing xmlunit-assertj module will still be supported in future releases but expect AssertJ 3.x specific changes to only get applied to xmlunit-assertj3.</p>

I think, the first proposal is a good step towards a better preview: Show the full names of authors and editors, to list the editor only if no author is present, have the year ealier. 

I disliked the default preview style, but could not make any (good) proposal. We need to keep the custom preview, because humanities have special requirements not met by CSL (especially displaying the comments field, ...)

<p>This module no longer uses AssertJ internal classes that are not exported to OSGi environments and thus fixes issue <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/xmlunit/xmlunit/issues/203"">#203</a>.</p>
<p>The module (like AssertJ 3.x itself) requires Java 8 at runtime and is similar to xmlunit-assertj but is no drop-in replacement. It uses a different Java package from xmlunit-assertj and <code>CompareAssert</code> will no longer throw a JUnit 4.x <code>ComparisonException</code> but an opentest4j <code>AssertionFailedError</code> instead.</p>

Refine default preview,7093,"This applies the quick fix proposed at https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/7083. To implement the full functionality a longer thought on previews is requried.

I think, the first proposal is a good step towards a better preview: Show the full names of authors and editors, to list the editor only if no author is present, have the year ealier. 

I disliked the default preview style, but could not make any (good) proposal. We need to keep the custom preview, because humanities have special requirements not met by CSL (especially displaying the comments field, ...)

<h2>XMLUnit for Java 2.8.1</h2>
<p>The only real change when compared to XMLUnit for Java 2.8.0 is the introduction of a new <code>xmlunit-assertj3</code> module that requires AssertJ 3.18.1 or later in order to address a problem with running AssertJ tests in an OSGi environment.</p>
<p>The original <code>xmlunit-assertj</code> module will still be supported.</p>
<p>The full changelog of XMLUnit for Java 2.8.1</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>added a new xmlunit-assertj3 module that requires AssertJ 3.18.1 or later.</p>
<p>This module no longer uses AssertJ internal classes that are not exported to OSGi environments and thus fixes issue <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/xmlunit/xmlunit/issues/203"">#203</a>.</p>
<p>The module (like AssertJ 3.x itself) requires Java 8 at runtime and is similar to xmlunit-assertj but is no drop-in replacement. It uses a different Java package from xmlunit-assertj and <code>CompareAssert</code> will no longer throw a JUnit 4.x <code>ComparisonException</code> but an opentest4j <code>AssertionFailedError</code> instead.</p>
<p>The existing xmlunit-assertj module will still be supported in future releases but expect AssertJ 3.x specific changes to only get applied to xmlunit-assertj3.</p>

<h2>XMLUnit for Java 2.8.1</h2>
<p>The only real change when compared to XMLUnit for Java 2.8.0 is the introduction of a new <code>xmlunit-assertj3</code> module that requires AssertJ 3.18.1 or later in order to address a problem with running AssertJ tests in an OSGi environment.</p>
<p>The original <code>xmlunit-assertj</code> module will still be supported.</p>
<p>The full changelog of XMLUnit for Java 2.8.1</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>added a new xmlunit-assertj3 module that requires AssertJ 3.18.1 or later.</p>
<p>This module no longer uses AssertJ internal classes that are not exported to OSGi environments and thus fixes issue <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/xmlunit/xmlunit/issues/203"">#203</a>.</p>
<p>The module (like AssertJ 3.x itself) requires Java 8 at runtime and is similar to xmlunit-assertj but is no drop-in replacement. It uses a different Java package from xmlunit-assertj and <code>CompareAssert</code> will no longer throw a JUnit 4.x <code>ComparisonException</code> but an opentest4j <code>AssertionFailedError</code> instead.</p>
<p>The existing xmlunit-assertj module will still be supported in future releases but expect AssertJ 3.x specific changes to only get applied to xmlunit-assertj3.</p>

I disliked the default preview style, but could not make any (good) proposal. We need to keep the custom preview, because humanities have special requirements not met by CSL (especially displaying the comments field, ...)

<h2>XMLUnit for Java 2.8.1</h2>
<p>The only real change when compared to XMLUnit for Java 2.8.0 is the introduction of a new <code>xmlunit-assertj3</code> module that requires AssertJ 3.18.1 or later in order to address a problem with running AssertJ tests in an OSGi environment.</p>
<p>The original <code>xmlunit-assertj</code> module will still be supported.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>added a new xmlunit-assertj3 module that requires AssertJ 3.18.1 or later.</p>
<p>This module no longer uses AssertJ internal classes that are not exported to OSGi environments and thus fixes issue <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/xmlunit/xmlunit/issues/203"">#203</a>.</p>
<p>The module (like AssertJ 3.x itself) requires Java 8 at runtime and is similar to xmlunit-assertj but is no drop-in replacement. It uses a different Java package from xmlunit-assertj and <code>CompareAssert</code> will no longer throw a JUnit 4.x <code>ComparisonException</code> but an opentest4j <code>AssertionFailedError</code> instead.</p>
<p>The existing xmlunit-assertj module will still be supported in future releases but expect AssertJ 3.x specific changes to only get applied to xmlunit-assertj3.</p>

I think, the first proposal is a good step towards a better preview: Show the full names of authors and editors, to list the editor only if no author is present, have the year ealier. 

I disliked the default preview style, but could not make any (good) proposal. We need to keep the custom preview, because humanities have special requirements not met by CSL (especially displaying the comments field, ...)

<p>The module (like AssertJ 3.x itself) requires Java 8 at runtime and is similar to xmlunit-assertj but is no drop-in replacement. It uses a different Java package from xmlunit-assertj and <code>CompareAssert</code> will no longer throw a JUnit 4.x <code>ComparisonException</code> but an opentest4j <code>AssertionFailedError</code> instead.</p>

Refine default preview,7093,"This applies the quick fix proposed at https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/7083. To implement the full functionality a longer thought on previews is requried.

I think, the first proposal is a good step towards a better preview: Show the full names of authors and editors, to list the editor only if no author is present, have the year ealier. 

I disliked the default preview style, but could not make any (good) proposal. We need to keep the custom preview, because humanities have special requirements not met by CSL (especially displaying the comments field, ...)

<h2>XMLUnit for Java 2.8.1</h2>
<p>The only real change when compared to XMLUnit for Java 2.8.0 is the introduction of a new <code>xmlunit-assertj3</code> module that requires AssertJ 3.18.1 or later in order to address a problem with running AssertJ tests in an OSGi environment.</p>
<p>The original <code>xmlunit-assertj</code> module will still be supported.</p>
<p>The full changelog of XMLUnit for Java 2.8.1</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>added a new xmlunit-assertj3 module that requires AssertJ 3.18.1 or later.</p>
<p>This module no longer uses AssertJ internal classes that are not exported to OSGi environments and thus fixes issue <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/xmlunit/xmlunit/issues/203"">#203</a>.</p>
<p>The module (like AssertJ 3.x itself) requires Java 8 at runtime and is similar to xmlunit-assertj but is no drop-in replacement. It uses a different Java package from xmlunit-assertj and <code>CompareAssert</code> will no longer throw a JUnit 4.x <code>ComparisonException</code> but an opentest4j <code>AssertionFailedError</code> instead.</p>
<p>The existing xmlunit-assertj module will still be supported in future releases but expect AssertJ 3.x specific changes to only get applied to xmlunit-assertj3.</p>

<h2>XMLUnit for Java 2.8.1</h2>
<p>The only real change when compared to XMLUnit for Java 2.8.0 is the introduction of a new <code>xmlunit-assertj3</code> module that requires AssertJ 3.18.1 or later in order to address a problem with running AssertJ tests in an OSGi environment.</p>
<p>The original <code>xmlunit-assertj</code> module will still be supported.</p>
<p>The full changelog of XMLUnit for Java 2.8.1</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>added a new xmlunit-assertj3 module that requires AssertJ 3.18.1 or later.</p>
<p>This module no longer uses AssertJ internal classes that are not exported to OSGi environments and thus fixes issue <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/xmlunit/xmlunit/issues/203"">#203</a>.</p>
<p>The module (like AssertJ 3.x itself) requires Java 8 at runtime and is similar to xmlunit-assertj but is no drop-in replacement. It uses a different Java package from xmlunit-assertj and <code>CompareAssert</code> will no longer throw a JUnit 4.x <code>ComparisonException</code> but an opentest4j <code>AssertionFailedError</code> instead.</p>
<p>The existing xmlunit-assertj module will still be supported in future releases but expect AssertJ 3.x specific changes to only get applied to xmlunit-assertj3.</p>

I disliked the default preview style, but could not make any (good) proposal. We need to keep the custom preview, because humanities have special requirements not met by CSL (especially displaying the comments field, ...)

You can request a key [at this link](https://www.oclc.org/developer/develop/authentication/how-to-request-a-wskey.en.html). The key can be added at [this line](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/compare/master...augustjanse:worldcat-fetcher#diff-81925a19f0349951de113d912a0747a6R25)

Have tested the fetcher and importer with XML content from their [test api](https://platform.worldcat.org/api-explorer/apis/wcapi/Bib/OpenSearch), which has yield successful results

<h2>XMLUnit for Java 2.8.1</h2>
<p>The only real change when compared to XMLUnit for Java 2.8.0 is the introduction of a new <code>xmlunit-assertj3</code> module that requires AssertJ 3.18.1 or later in order to address a problem with running AssertJ tests in an OSGi environment.</p>
<p>The original <code>xmlunit-assertj</code> module will still be supported.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>added a new xmlunit-assertj3 module that requires AssertJ 3.18.1 or later.</p>
<p>This module no longer uses AssertJ internal classes that are not exported to OSGi environments and thus fixes issue <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/xmlunit/xmlunit/issues/203"">#203</a>.</p>
<p>The module (like AssertJ 3.x itself) requires Java 8 at runtime and is similar to xmlunit-assertj but is no drop-in replacement. It uses a different Java package from xmlunit-assertj and <code>CompareAssert</code> will no longer throw a JUnit 4.x <code>ComparisonException</code> but an opentest4j <code>AssertionFailedError</code> instead.</p>
<p>The existing xmlunit-assertj module will still be supported in future releases but expect AssertJ 3.x specific changes to only get applied to xmlunit-assertj3.</p>

I think, the first proposal is a good step towards a better preview: Show the full names of authors and editors, to list the editor only if no author is present, have the year ealier. 

I disliked the default preview style, but could not make any (good) proposal. We need to keep the custom preview, because humanities have special requirements not met by CSL (especially displaying the comments field, ...)

Refine default preview,7093,"This applies the quick fix proposed at https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/7083. To implement the full functionality a longer thought on previews is requried.

I think, the first proposal is a good step towards a better preview: Show the full names of authors and editors, to list the editor only if no author is present, have the year ealier. 

I disliked the default preview style, but could not make any (good) proposal. We need to keep the custom preview, because humanities have special requirements not met by CSL (especially displaying the comments field, ...)

<h2>XMLUnit for Java 2.8.1</h2>
<p>The only real change when compared to XMLUnit for Java 2.8.0 is the introduction of a new <code>xmlunit-assertj3</code> module that requires AssertJ 3.18.1 or later in order to address a problem with running AssertJ tests in an OSGi environment.</p>
<p>The original <code>xmlunit-assertj</code> module will still be supported.</p>
<p>The full changelog of XMLUnit for Java 2.8.1</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>added a new xmlunit-assertj3 module that requires AssertJ 3.18.1 or later.</p>
<p>This module no longer uses AssertJ internal classes that are not exported to OSGi environments and thus fixes issue <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/xmlunit/xmlunit/issues/203"">#203</a>.</p>
<p>The module (like AssertJ 3.x itself) requires Java 8 at runtime and is similar to xmlunit-assertj but is no drop-in replacement. It uses a different Java package from xmlunit-assertj and <code>CompareAssert</code> will no longer throw a JUnit 4.x <code>ComparisonException</code> but an opentest4j <code>AssertionFailedError</code> instead.</p>
<p>The existing xmlunit-assertj module will still be supported in future releases but expect AssertJ 3.x specific changes to only get applied to xmlunit-assertj3.</p>

<h2>XMLUnit for Java 2.8.1</h2>
<p>The only real change when compared to XMLUnit for Java 2.8.0 is the introduction of a new <code>xmlunit-assertj3</code> module that requires AssertJ 3.18.1 or later in order to address a problem with running AssertJ tests in an OSGi environment.</p>
<p>The original <code>xmlunit-assertj</code> module will still be supported.</p>
<p>The full changelog of XMLUnit for Java 2.8.1</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>added a new xmlunit-assertj3 module that requires AssertJ 3.18.1 or later.</p>
<p>This module no longer uses AssertJ internal classes that are not exported to OSGi environments and thus fixes issue <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/xmlunit/xmlunit/issues/203"">#203</a>.</p>
<p>The module (like AssertJ 3.x itself) requires Java 8 at runtime and is similar to xmlunit-assertj but is no drop-in replacement. It uses a different Java package from xmlunit-assertj and <code>CompareAssert</code> will no longer throw a JUnit 4.x <code>ComparisonException</code> but an opentest4j <code>AssertionFailedError</code> instead.</p>
<p>The existing xmlunit-assertj module will still be supported in future releases but expect AssertJ 3.x specific changes to only get applied to xmlunit-assertj3.</p>
<p>Many thanks to <a href=""https://github.com/Zegveld"">@Zegveld</a>, <a href=""https://github.com/scordio"">@scordio</a> and  <a href=""https://github.com/joel-costigliola"">@joel-costigliola</a>.</p>

I disliked the default preview style, but could not make any (good) proposal. We need to keep the custom preview, because humanities have special requirements not met by CSL (especially displaying the comments field, ...)

jabref,Fix exception when saving and autosave trigger at the same time,6694,"Fixes #6684
Fixes  #6644 
Fixes #6102
Fixes #6000 

Summary:
Manual save + autosave produce an exception/race condition on saving, because both want to access the same file for moving the temp file to the target file.

Solution: Throttle multiple saving operations in a kind of queue

<p>The only real change when compared to XMLUnit for Java 2.8.0 is the introduction of a new <code>xmlunit-assertj3</code> module that requires AssertJ 3.18.1 or later in order to address a problem with running AssertJ tests in an OSGi environment.</p>
<p>The original <code>xmlunit-assertj</code> module will still be supported.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>added a new xmlunit-assertj3 module that requires AssertJ 3.18.1 or later.</p>
<p>This module no longer uses AssertJ internal classes that are not exported to OSGi environments and thus fixes issue <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/xmlunit/xmlunit/issues/203"">#203</a>.</p>
<p>The module (like AssertJ 3.x itself) requires Java 8 at runtime and is similar to xmlunit-assertj but is no drop-in replacement. It uses a different Java package from xmlunit-assertj and <code>CompareAssert</code> will no longer throw a JUnit 4.x <code>ComparisonException</code> but an opentest4j <code>AssertionFailedError</code> instead.</p>
<p>The existing xmlunit-assertj module will still be supported in future releases but expect AssertJ 3.x specific changes to only get applied to xmlunit-assertj3.</p>

<h2>XMLUnit for Java 2.8.1</h2>
<p>The only real change when compared to XMLUnit for Java 2.8.0 is the introduction of a new <code>xmlunit-assertj3</code> module that requires AssertJ 3.18.1 or later in order to address a problem with running AssertJ tests in an OSGi environment.</p>
<p>The original <code>xmlunit-assertj</code> module will still be supported.</p>
<p>The full changelog of XMLUnit for Java 2.8.1</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>added a new xmlunit-assertj3 module that requires AssertJ 3.18.1 or later.</p>
<p>This module no longer uses AssertJ internal classes that are not exported to OSGi environments and thus fixes issue <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/xmlunit/xmlunit/issues/203"">#203</a>.</p>
<p>The module (like AssertJ 3.x itself) requires Java 8 at runtime and is similar to xmlunit-assertj but is no drop-in replacement. It uses a different Java package from xmlunit-assertj and <code>CompareAssert</code> will no longer throw a JUnit 4.x <code>ComparisonException</code> but an opentest4j <code>AssertionFailedError</code> instead.</p>
<p>The existing xmlunit-assertj module will still be supported in future releases but expect AssertJ 3.x specific changes to only get applied to xmlunit-assertj3.</p>
<p>Many thanks to <a href=""https://github.com/Zegveld"">@Zegveld</a>, <a href=""https://github.com/scordio"">@scordio</a> and  <a href=""https://github.com/joel-costigliola"">@joel-costigliola</a>.</p>

<h2>XMLUnit for Java 2.8.1</h2>
<p>The only real change when compared to XMLUnit for Java 2.8.0 is the introduction of a new <code>xmlunit-assertj3</code> module that requires AssertJ 3.18.1 or later in order to address a problem with running AssertJ tests in an OSGi environment.</p>
<p>The original <code>xmlunit-assertj</code> module will still be supported.</p>
<p>The full changelog of XMLUnit for Java 2.8.1</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>added a new xmlunit-assertj3 module that requires AssertJ 3.18.1 or later.</p>
<p>This module no longer uses AssertJ internal classes that are not exported to OSGi environments and thus fixes issue <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/xmlunit/xmlunit/issues/203"">#203</a>.</p>
<p>The module (like AssertJ 3.x itself) requires Java 8 at runtime and is similar to xmlunit-assertj but is no drop-in replacement.

I disliked the default preview style, but could not make any (good) proposal. We need to keep the custom preview, because humanities have special requirements not met by CSL (especially displaying the comments field, ...)

Manual save + autosave produce an exception/race condition on saving, because both want to access the same file for moving the temp file to the target file.

<h2>XMLUnit for Java 2.8.1</h2>
<p>The only real change when compared to XMLUnit for Java 2.8.0 is the introduction of a new <code>xmlunit-assertj3</code> module that requires AssertJ 3.18.1 or later in order to address a problem with running AssertJ tests in an OSGi environment.</p>
<p>The original <code>xmlunit-assertj</code> module will still be supported.</p>
<p>The full changelog of XMLUnit for Java 2.8.1</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>added a new xmlunit-assertj3 module that requires AssertJ 3.18.1 or later.</p>
<p>This module no longer uses AssertJ internal classes that are not exported to OSGi environments and thus fixes issue <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/xmlunit/xmlunit/issues/203"">#203</a>.</p>
<p>The module (like AssertJ 3.x itself) requires Java 8 at runtime and is similar to xmlunit-assertj but is no drop-in replacement. It uses a different Java package from xmlunit-assertj and <code>CompareAssert</code> will no longer throw a JUnit 4.x <code>ComparisonException</code> but an opentest4j <code>AssertionFailedError</code> instead.</p>
<p>The existing xmlunit-assertj module will still be supported in future releases but expect AssertJ 3.x specific changes to only get applied to xmlunit-assertj3.</p>

<blockquote>
<h2>XMLUnit for Java 2.8.1 - /Released 2020-11-15/</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>added a new xmlunit-assertj3 module that requires AssertJ 3.18.1 or
later.</p>
<p>This module no longer uses AssertJ internal classes that are not
exported to OSGi environments and thus fixes issue <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/xmlunit/xmlunit/issues/203"">#203</a>.</p>
<p>The module (like AssertJ 3.x itself) requires Java 8 at runtime and
is similar to xmlunit-assertj but is no drop-in replacement. It uses
a different Java package from xmlunit-assertj and <code>CompareAssert</code>
will no longer throw a JUnit 4.x <code>ComparisonException</code> but an
opentest4j <code>AssertionFailedError</code> instead.</p>
<p>The existing xmlunit-assertj module will still be supported in
future releases but expect AssertJ 3.x specific changes to only get
applied to xmlunit-assertj3.</p>

<p>The only real change when compared to XMLUnit for Java 2.8.0 is the introduction of a new <code>xmlunit-assertj3</code> module that requires AssertJ 3.18.1 or later in order to address a problem with running AssertJ tests in an OSGi environment.</p>
<p>The original <code>xmlunit-assertj</code> module will still be supported.</p>
<p>The full changelog of XMLUnit for Java 2.8.1</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>added a new xmlunit-assertj3 module that requires AssertJ 3.18.1 or later.</p>
<p>This module no longer uses AssertJ internal classes that are not exported to OSGi environments and thus fixes issue <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/xmlunit/xmlunit/issues/203"">#203</a>.</p>
<p>The module (like AssertJ 3.x itself) requires Java 8 at runtime and is similar to xmlunit-assertj but is no drop-in replacement. It uses a different Java package from xmlunit-assertj and <code>CompareAssert</code> will no longer throw a JUnit 4.x <code>ComparisonException</code> but an opentest4j <code>AssertionFailedError</code> instead.</p>
<p>The existing xmlunit-assertj module will still be supported in future releases but expect AssertJ 3.x specific changes to only get applied to xmlunit-assertj3.</p>

I disliked the default preview style, but could not make any (good) proposal. We need to keep the custom preview, because humanities have special requirements not met by CSL (especially displaying the comments field, ...)

<h2>XMLUnit for Java 2.8.1</h2>
<p>The only real change when compared to XMLUnit for Java 2.8.0 is the introduction of a new <code>xmlunit-assertj3</code> module that requires AssertJ 3.18.1 or later in order to address a problem with running AssertJ tests in an OSGi environment.</p>
<p>The original <code>xmlunit-assertj</code> module will still be supported.</p>
<p>The full changelog of XMLUnit for Java 2.8.1</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>added a new xmlunit-assertj3 module that requires AssertJ 3.18.1 or later.</p>
<p>This module no longer uses AssertJ internal classes that are not exported to OSGi environments and thus fixes issue <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/xmlunit/xmlunit/issues/203"">#203</a>.</p>
<p>The module (like AssertJ 3.x itself) requires Java 8 at runtime and is similar to xmlunit-assertj but is no drop-in replacement. It uses a different Java package from xmlunit-assertj and <code>CompareAssert</code> will no longer throw a JUnit 4.x <code>ComparisonException</code> but an opentest4j <code>AssertionFailedError</code> instead.</p>
<p>The existing xmlunit-assertj module will still be supported in future releases but expect AssertJ 3.x specific changes to only get applied to xmlunit-assertj3.</p>

jabref,Refine default preview,7093,"This applies the quick fix proposed at https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/7083. To implement the full functionality a longer thought on previews is requried.

I think, the first proposal is a good step towards a better preview: Show the full names of authors and editors, to list the editor only if no author is present, have the year ealier. 

I disliked the default preview style, but could not make any (good) proposal. We need to keep the custom preview, because humanities have special requirements not met by CSL (especially displaying the comments field, ...)

<h2>XMLUnit for Java 2.8.1</h2>
<p>The only real change when compared to XMLUnit for Java 2.8.0 is the introduction of a new <code>xmlunit-assertj3</code> module that requires AssertJ 3.18.1 or later in order to address a problem with running AssertJ tests in an OSGi environment.</p>
<p>The original <code>xmlunit-assertj</code> module will still be supported.</p>
<p>The full changelog of XMLUnit for Java 2.8.1</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>added a new xmlunit-assertj3 module that requires AssertJ 3.18.1 or later.</p>
<p>This module no longer uses AssertJ internal classes that are not exported to OSGi environments and thus fixes issue <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/xmlunit/xmlunit/issues/203"">#203</a>.</p>
<p>The module (like AssertJ 3.x itself) requires Java 8 at runtime and is similar to xmlunit-assertj but is no drop-in replacement. It uses a different Java package from xmlunit-assertj and <code>CompareAssert</code> will no longer throw a JUnit 4.x <code>ComparisonException</code> but an opentest4j <code>AssertionFailedError</code> instead.</p>
<p>The existing xmlunit-assertj module will still be supported in future releases but expect AssertJ 3.x specific changes to only get applied to xmlunit-assertj3.</p>

<h2>XMLUnit for Java 2.8.1</h2>
<p>The only real change when compared to XMLUnit for Java 2.8.0 is the introduction of a new <code>xmlunit-assertj3</code> module that requires AssertJ 3.18.1 or later in order to address a problem with running AssertJ tests in an OSGi environment.</p>
<p>The original <code>xmlunit-assertj</code> module will still be supported.</p>
<p>The full changelog of XMLUnit for Java 2.8.1</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>added a new xmlunit-assertj3 module that requires AssertJ 3.18.1 or later.</p>
<p>This module no longer uses AssertJ internal classes that are not exported to OSGi environments and thus fixes issue <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/xmlunit/xmlunit/issues/203"">#203</a>.</p>
<p>The module (like AssertJ 3.x itself) requires Java 8 at runtime and is similar to xmlunit-assertj but is no drop-in replacement. It uses a different Java package from xmlunit-assertj and <code>CompareAssert</code> will no longer throw a JUnit 4.x <code>ComparisonException</code> but an opentest4j <code>AssertionFailedError</code> instead.</p>
<p>The existing xmlunit-assertj module will still be supported in future releases but expect AssertJ 3.x specific changes to only get applied to xmlunit-assertj3.</p>

I disliked the default preview style, but could not make any (good) proposal. We need to keep the custom preview, because humanities have special requirements not met by CSL (especially displaying the comments field, ...)

<h2>XMLUnit for Java 2.8.1</h2>
<p>The only real change when compared to XMLUnit for Java 2.8.0 is the introduction of a new <code>xmlunit-assertj3</code> module that requires AssertJ 3.18.1 or later in order to address a problem with running AssertJ tests in an OSGi environment.</p>
<p>The original <code>xmlunit-assertj</code> module will still be supported.</p>
<p>The full changelog of XMLUnit for Java 2.8.1</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>added a new xmlunit-assertj3 module that requires AssertJ 3.18.1 or later.</p>
<p>This module no longer uses AssertJ internal classes that are not exported to OSGi environments and thus fixes issue <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/xmlunit/xmlunit/issues/203"">#203</a>.</p>
<p>The module (like AssertJ 3.x itself) requires Java 8 at runtime and is similar to xmlunit-assertj but is no drop-in replacement. It uses a different Java package from xmlunit-assertj and <code>CompareAssert</code> will no longer throw a JUnit 4.x <code>ComparisonException</code> but an opentest4j <code>AssertionFailedError</code> instead.</p>
<p>The existing xmlunit-assertj module will still be supported in future releases but expect AssertJ 3.x specific changes to only get applied to xmlunit-assertj3.</p>

I disliked the default preview style, but could not make any (good) proposal. We need to keep the custom preview, because humanities have special requirements not met by CSL (especially displaying the comments field, ...)

jabref,Fix exception when saving and autosave trigger at the same time,6694,"Fixes #6684
Fixes  #6644 
Fixes #6102
Fixes #6000 

Summary:
Manual save + autosave produce an exception/race condition on saving, because both want to access the same file for moving the temp file to the target file.

Solution: Throttle multiple saving operations in a kind of queue

jabref,Add Worldcat fetcher,6035,"Add EntryBased fetcher for the Worldcat databse (#2581, #1065)

Problem right now is the API key. Tried requesting a sandbox key, but the request was denied. However I believe you being a trusted organisation might have better luck. You can request a key [at this link](https://www.oclc.org/developer/develop/authentication/how-to-request-a-wskey.en.html). The key can be added at [this line](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/compare/master...augustjanse:worldcat-fetcher#diff-81925a19f0349951de113d912a0747a6R25)
