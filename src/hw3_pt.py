'''
The Periodic Table of the Elements was developed to organize information about the elements that make up the Universe. Write a terminal application that lets you enter information about each element in the periodic table. Make sure you include the following information:

    symbol, name, atomic number, row, and column

Provide a menu of options for users (inputing numbers) to:

    See all the information that is stored about any element, by entering that element's symbol.
    Choose a property, and see that property for each element in the table.
    Enter a new element
    Change the attributes of an element, by entering the element's symbol.
    Exit the program

You can provide a pre-populated dictionary as part of your program, avoiding the need of typing every time
